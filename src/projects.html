    <h2>Pure Python Text Game</h2>
    <p>
        This game is the first fully functional terminal app that I built using python.
        It utilizes classes, methods, functions, python packages, variables, user input and more.
        I built an earlier version following a tutorial on Stackskills.
        For this version I started from scratch, only using the early version for reference.
        I avoided copy-pasting to ensure I fully understood the various coding skills involved.

    <h2>First Ruby Terminal App</h2>
    <p>
        For our first assignment we were tasked to create a Ruby terminal application (app) in pairs.
        My partner Mike and I decided to make a program that would recommend a song based on your mood or an occasion.
        We looked at Spotify for our case study and observed how many steps it took to discover a song that we enjoyed.
        We wondered if there was a way to shorten and simplify these steps. This was the mission statement which we wrote.
        “Finding a song that fits your mood or occasion takes effort. Imagine if Ben & Mike chose the music for you. With Ben & Mike’s Song Suggestor, you can listen to curated tunes in just a few clicks.”

    <h2>My First Foray Into CSS</h2>
    <p>
        The following is a screenshot of my early efforst to style a prebuilt html file.
        The html is taken from <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Css Zen Garden</a>.
        The site is an effort to provide the tech community with a way to demosntrate the power of css.
